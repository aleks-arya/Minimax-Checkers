# Minimax-Checkers

The Checkers are made with Godot Game Engine. The project files can be run there in the Debug mode.
In the ZIP file there is a ready Windows executable file with which game can be run without Godot installed.

To start the game, simply run the executable file.
In the game player can choose white or black pawns. White pawns move first. To move, left-click pawn with mouse, then click on the square pawn should be moved to.
Player is limited to correct moves, and have to capture enemy pawns if possible.

Game can be canceled at any time by clicking "<" button on the down-left side of game window, which returns player to main menu.
